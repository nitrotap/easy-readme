## Description

Easy Readme is a command-line app using node.js, npm, and inquirer. The CLI walks the user through questions about their project, and generates a professional, customized readme.md file in the /dist folder. The readme incorporates dynamically generated table of contents, badges based on the selected license, and generates a markdown file to add to your repo.
